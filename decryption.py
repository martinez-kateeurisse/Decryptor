#DECRYPTION
#A Python Script that accepts a string as encrypted text and then the program will decrypt it using the following character substitute:
#'a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !

#Ask the user to input an encrypted text
#Check each character of the user's input
#If '*', change to 'a'
#If '&', change to 'e'
#If '#', change to 'i'
#If '+', change to 'o'
#If '!', change to 'u'

#Print the output
